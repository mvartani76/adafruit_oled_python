# adafruit_oled_python
All adafruit code required to get adafruit oled python code working.

Starting from the following tutorial

https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2018/04/i2c-oled-display-module-with-raspberry-pi/

I noticed that there were a few modules missing so I decided to group all the required code together into one repository as of 15 January 2019.

The source for the Python SSD1306 code is:

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_ssd1306

This code references the following two adafruit modules
Python_GPIO: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO
Python_PureIO: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PureIO
